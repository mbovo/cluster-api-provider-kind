# 1. Using ADR

Date: 2022-10-25

## Status

Accepted

## Context

To track the decision process, the architecture and the rationale behind the decisions, we need to record them in a way that is understandable by anyone.

## Decision

Using [ADR](https://adr.github.io/) (Architecture Decision Records) is a good way to record the decisions.

## Consequences

All decisions must be recorded as ADR document under `docs/adr` prior to be implemented.
